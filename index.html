                        As an overview, the number of casualities over the years are relatively low, with most collisions 
                        occuring around Brisbane. The high density of collisions around Brisbane and the Gold Coast compliments 
                        the fact these are major cities, major tourist locations and have heavy traffic conditions throughout the years. 
                        Collisions tend to occur along the coastline and this coincides with high traffic areas as the major towns in Queensland are located along the coast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of the severity of collisions, the road accidents tend to occur mostly in a 60km/h speed limt with 
                        the least number of collision occuring in a 70km/h speed limit. Proportionally, the most about of fatalities 
                        come from higher speed collisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Considering the time of day, the number of collisions are higher around 8am and between 3-5pm. This trend is as 
                        expected as these are peak traffic hours in which more vehicles are on the roads, regardless of which month of the year.
